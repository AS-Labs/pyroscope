# Grafana Fire Reads resources dashboard

The Reads resources dashboard shows CPU, memory, disk, and other resources utilization profiles.
The dashboard isolates each service on the read path into its own section and displays the order in which a read request flows.

This dashboard requires [additional resources profiles]({{< relref "../../requirements.md#additional-resources-profiles" >}}).
