# Grafana Fire Writes resources dashboard

The Writes resources dashboard shows CPU, memory, disk, and other resource utilization profiles.
The dashboard isolates each service on the write path into its own section and displays the order in which a write request flows.

This dashboard requires [additional resources profiles]({{< relref "../../requirements.md#additional-resources-profiles" >}}).

## Example

The following example shows a Writes resources dashboard from a demo cluster.
